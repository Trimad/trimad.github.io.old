Kilihau Street is on the south side of Oahu, just north of Ke'ehi Lagoon Beach Park. It's subject to heavy flooding a few times a month due to King Tides which means that if you're not informed about the tide, you could be driving your car through a foot of sea water and rusting out the undercarriage of your vehicle. Plenty of tide reports already exist, but I wanted a better one (without ads) that pulls data from the NOAA tide sensor closest to Kilihau so that the report is most representative of what we're actually experiencing on Kilihau Street.

There are two graphs. The top graph is the real-time graph that updates every 6 minutes, showing the observed tide in blue and the predicted tide in red. The bottom graph is the predicted tide for the entire current month.
