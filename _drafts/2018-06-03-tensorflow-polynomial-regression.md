<p>In its current state, this sketch combines p5.js and tensorflow.js to fit a third degree polynomial to a series of points. Points can be added by simply clicking on the graph. The domain of the graph is normalized between -1 and 1 using p5.js's map function.</p><p><a href="https://trimad.github.io/tf-polynomial-regression/">Preview with GitHub Pages</a></p><p><a href="https://github.com/Trimad/tf-polynomial-regression">View the GitHub Repository</a><br></p>
