This problem deals with a pretty small graph, so I chose to implement the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm">Floyd-Warshall Algorithm</a> instead of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm">Dijkstra's Algorithm</a> for the sake of simplicity. This algorithm finds the shortest path between every pair of vertices in a graph so it runs in O(n^3) time. Which sounds bad, but the UVA judge accepted this program with a run time of 0.12s which is well withing the 3-second threshold. I wrote this algorithm in an object-oriented, array-averse way so that if I ever have enough free time I can drop this into to Processing and visualize it in 3D.
