I recently sought out to find an easier way to create perfectly looped animations and discovered the idea of 4D Simplex Noise. The internet oracles led me to necessarydisorder's WordPress tutorial, entitled <a href="https://necessarydisorder.wordpress.com/2017/11/15/drawing-from-noise-and-then-making-animated-loopy-gifs-from-there/">Drawing from noise, and then making animated loopy GIFs from there</a>. which I found to be very informative, inspiring and aptly named. I built upon what I've done in previous projects; created a 2D grid of pixel objects and animating them, this time mapping their motion to the <a href="https://gist.github.com/Bleuje/fce86ef35b66c4a2b6a469b27163591e">noise function</a>. At lower scales (0.001) the motion is organic and smooth enough to produce some nice effects.
