This PowerShell script generates a report showing all groups and group members when run on an on-premises domain controller. The script requires that you import the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/activedirectory/?view=windowsserver2022-ps">ActiveDirectory</a> module. The report is in .csv format so the rows may need some manipulation to see all the members if you're opening it in Excel.
