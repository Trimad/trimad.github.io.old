I was inspired by <a href="https://www.bradyharanblog.com/blog/the-collatz-conjecture-in-colour">this page</a> to write my own Collatz Conjecture visualization. My first attempt looked pretty close to what I saw in the Numberphile video which is fine and dandy. I tried something different by keeping the rules used to create the original visualization, but wrapping everything around a unit circle. There are 360 "branches", each branch representing a 1-degree turn. I donâ€™t suspect this reveals any new insights into the Collatz Conjecture, but I had fun and it yielded some interesting looking results. The number 327 has a particularly long and interesting life here. The output frames of this Processing sketch were assembled using [ffmpeg]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2022-04-16-ffmpeg.md %}).
